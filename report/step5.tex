\section*{Step 5 - Car service}

Each car has a `repair' semaphore

Two solutions
- Check in each `run' loop whether `needsRepair', then handle it next iteration
-- car might make one more move before being removed
--

- Send an interrupt to the car thread, catch it in the `run' loop
-- More complex!
-- Requires another while (true)
-- Difficult to clean up after the car since we don't know when it was interrupted
-- Car will be removed instantly
