\section{Introduction}

Since the analogy of cars to threads is used throughout the assignment specification, the word ``car'' is used interchangingly with ``thread'' in this report. We refer to the value of the counter in a semaphore as ``tokens'', meaning that we can ``add'' a token (a ``P'' operation) and we can request or take a token (a ``V'' operation).

The following sections each describe one step of the assignment and are presented in the order they were given. Generally we give an analysis of the problem at hand, present som design considerations and end with the implementation details that were carried out.

We end the report with a description of how we have tested the implementations and conclusions we have drawn from working with the assignment.
