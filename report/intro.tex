\section*{Introduction}

Since the analogy of cars to threads is used throughout the assignment specification, the word ``car'' is used interchangingly with ``thread'' in this report. We refer to the value of the counter in a semaphore as ``tokens'', meaning that we can ``add'' a token (a ``P'' operation) and we can request or take a token (a ``V'' operation).
